CMYK is a lean digital agency based in Gowanus, Brooklyn with inhouse design and tech teams that interface closely to create unique interactive media. I work with CMYK on a project basis, providing UX and Visual design heavy lifting on apps and web projects.

Case Study – Silicon Valley At Home
</h2>
<h3><a href="http://siliconvalleyathome.org/" target="_blank">siliconvalleyathome.org</a></h3>

<p>
I worked through Gowanus-based creative agency <a href="http://wearecmyk.com" target="_blank">CMYK</a> to design a custom site for San José-based Silicon Valley At Home, a Bay Area affordable housing advocacy group. They work with partners such as Google to help fight the area's housing crisis. Given the organization's location and network, we went with a techy future-forward look and feel that defies the expectations of a standard non-profit site and offers a rich and engaging experience. 
</p>

<p>
I began by reviewing CMKY's creative direction and designed three initial look and feel directions, and through several revision cycles with the client, evolved the design concept into a flexible, responsive system that integrated with their existing engagement platforms. The final visual design is informed by the post-modernist architectural style of new Bay Area development projects: making use of dramatic geometry, vivid colors, and foggy glass. I sat in on QA sessions with CMYK's in-house development team at various stages of the project to hone a launch-ready product that serves as a big upgrade from their previous website.
