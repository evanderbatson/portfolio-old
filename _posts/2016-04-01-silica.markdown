<p>
Silica Magazine is your travel guide to the environmental apocalypse: reporting on the planetâ€™s changing landscapes through investigative journalism and interactive art. I helped co-found Silica in 2016 and have served as Creative Director across its past three yearly issues, designing and building its brand, campaigns, and publishing platform.

<h3>The Critter Issue</h3>

<p>
Our latest issue, Critters, was funded by and co-published with <a href='http://engadget.com/silica' target='_blank'>Engadget.com</a> whose features team partnered with us to do a week-long frontpage takeover. The Critter Issue explores natural ecology in the internet age, asking the question: what is wildlife when the world is no longer wild?

<p>
Principle work on the issue spanned the first half of 2018. During the planning and strategy stage, I created a visual identity for the issue that incorporated digitally-generated organic forms with hard-edge typographic treatments to reinforce the themes present in the content that was simultaneously being developed by the editorial team. To compliment the typographic design of the campaign, I created textural digital objects based on 3d scans of organic forms for a full range of RFP and art-direction <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PNPqcDg8BdRVxF4OkJrz5oONxDCX1gQ1/view?usp=sharing' target='_blank'>presentations</a>, social media assets, and internal branding.

<p>
As Creative Director, much of my work involved concepting, commissioning, and art directing original work from a talented pool of contributors. Coordinating with our internal editorial team, the Engadget editorial team, and our contributing writers, I linked the written narratives to the visual narratives of our contributing artists and creative technologists. 
</p>

<p>
I also spearheaded execution, within both the Engadget and Silicamag CMS, both of which were given extensive overhauls to accommodate the new content types. On the engadget side, I coordinated these efforts with the Senior Features Editor and their internal dev team. On the Silica side, I refined the UX and visual design of the site to reflect the expansion of the platform and content types.

<p>
Critters proved to be the most media-rich and journalistically deep endeavor Silica has yet undertaken, encompassing hundreds of hours of work by a broad and diverse team of writers, artists, coders, and editors, collaborating on everything from t-shirt designs to 360 immersive media. The issue launch was celebrated at <a href='https://imprintprojects.com/' target='_blank'>Imprint Projects</a> in SOHO, NYC.

<h3>The Greater Silica Ecosystem</h3>

<p>
<a href='http://silicamag.com/issues/lakes/' target='_blank'>The Lake Issue</a> was born from discovering a lost lake in the heart of Appalachia. <a href='http://silicamag.com/issues/homeland/' target='_blank'>The Homeland Issue</a> rose from a crowd-funded revolt in the American landscape. <a href='http://silicamag.com/issues/critters/' target='_blank'>The Critter Issue</a> hatched from under the wing of a major publisher. I invite you to explore this online ecology, every detail of which we have handcrafted from the bare essentials.
</p>

<p>
Silica seeks to take the reader on a voyage. Many of our interactives patch in public satellite data that recreate places across the world right there in your browser window, a travel magazine for a world in which the physical and digital landscapes are intractably interconnected. We have entered into a new kind of frontier where the map is the territory, ready to be explored by tapping open a new tab.
</p>
<p>
Silicamag.com, with its yearly thematic issues, is the heart of Silica. As an entity, it is larger than just a website. Silica is a community. We are experimenting with expanding horizontally into events, branded partnerships, print media, VR, streaming video, and other spaces both online and offline.
