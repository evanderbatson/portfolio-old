description: Design of brand identity / ecosystem, and responsive website.
role: Creative Director – Digital and Interactive Design – Creative Coding
location: NYC 

blurb1: I joined up with Editor-In-Chief <a href="http://twitter.com/ivesstive" target="_blank">Casey Halter</a> (writer for POZ, VICE, Betaworks) and Managing Editor <a href="">Shannon Lee</a> (producer and production assistant for NOWNESS, David Byrne, Arielle De Pinto) to spearhead the first issue of Silica Magazine, a geographic travel guide to our changing planet in the digital era. I sought to carve out a niche for Silica's identity using proto-trend internet culture aesthetics, cutting-edge interactive multimedia, and crystal-clear editorial design.

blurb2: The first issue of Silica Magazine is focused on lakes and freshwater. I wanted the art direction to reflects this, using aquatic designs as vessels for establishing context and enriching the thematic feeling. In one story, I worked with shader-specialist <a href="http://twitter.com/whoisbma" target="_blank">Bryan Ma</a> in creating a real-time rendered water environment to serve as a backdrop for the music feature <a href="http://silicamag.com/gallery/glacier-recordings" target="_blank">In Resurrection Bay</a>, where the featured musician traveled to Alaska to digitally record the sounds of melting glaciers. In our atmospheric video feature NOBODIES, we produced a video paired with a report covering the state California's dying Salton Sea – now exacerbated by prevailing drought conditions.

blurb3: In the interactive 3D feature <a href="http://silicamag.com/commentary/aral-sea" target="_blank">Stealing the Aral Sea</a>, I patched together satellite data from NASA and the USGS in Cinema4D, designed a layout in Sketch, and using jekyll and threejs, built a scrolling experience demonstrating how what was once the world's fourth largest lake has become a desert.

blurb4: Silica Mag's primary design challenge was addressing the question "How can we make environmental reporting sexy and relevant?" We shed the tree-hugger trappings associated with environmental discourse and went with an edgy art-house look inspired by netart and zine culture. This goes along with our philosophy of "come for the art, stay for the science" which drives traffic and fulfills the non-profit's funders' goals.
