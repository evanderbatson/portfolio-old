role: Web Designer â€“ Creative Coding
location: NYC 

blurb1: Hover Pictures broke ground as a documentary production agency in early 2014 - as a collective of artists and filmmakers working out of a loft in Chinatown - going on to shoot countless compelling human-interest stories. The primary commercial work has been branded video content for media-buying companies like MEDIACOM, although Hover has worked on everything from NPO projects to art films. I was brought in to bring the movie-magic to the web.

blurb3: I teamed up with local favorite Bushwick-based visual designers <a href="http://www.eyebodega.com/" target="_blank">EyeBodega</a>, who crafted the striking Hover Pictures emblem and wordmark and selected the type treatments, to create the agency's bespoke, responsive website that is true to the company's vibe and showcases its video work in the way it deserves. To this end, I designed and skinned a custom video player and worked with the company's video editors on the embedded 'portraits' and 'landscapes' reels to tell the scope and story of the company's work.
