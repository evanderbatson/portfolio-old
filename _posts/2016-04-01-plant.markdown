Ever wish you could remember the species name of that succulent on your window sill? When was the last time you watered that little guy? <i>Was it last week, or the week before last?</i> Plant App (codename) is an forthcoming smartphone utility app designed for indoor plant owners who want to have a pleasing and simple augmented reality experience, that also helps keep their plants healthy.

Plant App combines sharp user-experience design with an energized art direction to create an app that is laser-pointer simple, breezily intuitive, and a joy to use. Inspired by games like <b>Neko Atsume</b> and <b>Pok√©mon Go</b>, Plant App uses the fun parts of gamification, while cutting out anything that would waste your precious plant time. You've got like a hundred of succulents in your apartment to take care of, after all. <i>But is there a zenned-out ambient soundtrack to listen to while you are watering your plants?</i> Duh. More info coming soon!
