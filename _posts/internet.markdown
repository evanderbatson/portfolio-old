description: Design of a web-based 3D/VR video art gallery. 
role: Designer – 3D Producer – Creative Coder
location: NYC 

blurb1: "How can video art be displayed on the web? The feeling of the TV in space is a big part of the video art curatorial experience. To display it online, does embedding it in a standard video player fit the situational intentions of the artist? My-internet.me presents a tongue-in-cheek answer to this question: displaying the work on a virtual space on a three-dimensional facsimile of a cathode-tube video monitor in a neutral internet space."

blurb2: "I used webgl and standard html input forms to create the interactive 3D interface of My-internet.me. The inaugural show presents exclusive works of the gallery's permanent collection, showcasing the works of multidisciplinary artists such as Laura A Warman, Brian Pineyro, Marcus McDonald, George Clanton, and Kevin Knight."

blurb3: For the next phase of the project, I am working with art and design guru <a href="http://sophiacallahan.net/" target="_blank">Sophia Callahan</a> who is curating a new my-internet.me show with a diverse range of video and new media artists. Stay tuned for more info!
