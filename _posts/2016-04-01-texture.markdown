<h2>
Agency – Texture Group
</h2>
<h3><a href="http://texturegroup.com" target="_blank">texturegroup.com</a></h3>
<p>
Agency veteran Bob Maynard (formerly Sweden Unlimited, R/GA, Razorfish) recently struck out on his own to found a new kind of strategy consultancy. I work with  Texture Group to build bespoke websites and craft <a href='http://texturegroup.com/journal' target='_blank'>original digital content</a> for clients in the music, fashion, film, and restaurant industries.

<h2>
Client – Hover Pictures
</h2>
<h3><a href="http://www.hoverpictures.com/" target="_blank">hoverpictures.com</a></h3>
<p>
Hover is a branded-content production agency that shoots compelling human-interest stories. I teamed up with Texture Group and visual designers <a href="http://www.eyebodega.com/" target="_blank">EyeBodega</a>, who crafted the identity and type treatments, to create the agency's website that is true to the company's vibe and showcases its video work in the way it deserves. I worked with the company's video editors on the embedded ‘portraits’ and ‘landscapes’ reels to tell the scope and story of the company’s work.

<h2>
Client – CIRCA BREWING CO
</h2>
<h3><a href="http://circabrewing.co/" target="_blank">circabrewing.co</a></h3>
<p>
I worked with Texture in building a custom wordpress site for downtown Brooklyn's newest pizzeria and brewery. In collaboration with <a href="http://www.mgmtdesign.com" target="_blank">mgmt.</a>, we took a holistic approach to designing the restaurant's brand. The website meticulously mirrors the architecture and design of the brewery's interior, down to the aesthetics of the furniture, the machinery of the brewing vats, and even the typeface on the neon sign. 
</p>
<p>
Beyond the look and feel, <a href="http://circabrewing.co" target="_blank">Circabrewing.co</a> functions smoothly across desktop and mobile with a custom-built tabbed menu system, and integrates useful toolkits to reserve tables and even order food straight from the kitchen.
